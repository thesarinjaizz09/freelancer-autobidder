Create a campaign inside the CRM, choose broadcast/personalised/automated flow, and hit send.\n2. See the message appear on my own WhatsApp device.\n3.

The core of the job is building (or wiring together) a solution that automatically ingests those MOV files, detects every point, and returns clear statistics. The focus is strictly on player performance, not general broadcast highlights or biomechanics.\n\nMetrics that must come back from each processed match:\n• Serve accuracy for each player, split by first and second serve\n• Rally length, point by point and averaged per set\n• Shot types with their individual success rate (forehand, backhand, volley, smash, etc.)\n\nA summary table or JSON output per match is fine as long as the numbers are reliable.

        "full_description": "Full-Stack Development of a Web-Based HR Consulting App using Pure PHP (No Frameworks)\n\nDetailed Project Description\nHello to all talented freelancers,\n\nWe are seeking a professional and experienced Full-Stack PHP developer to build a complete, ready-to-use web application from scratch. The project, named “sumHRo”, will be a platform for booking and receiving online Human Resources consulting services.\n\nThe most critical and non-negotiable requirement for this project is the use of modern, pure PHP (version 8 or higher) for the back-end, without the use of any frameworks like Laravel, Symfony, etc. This is a strict requirement, and your proposal must demonstrate your expertise and experience in non-framework PHP development.\n\nThe application will include a robust authentication system, separate dashboards based on user roles (admin, consultant, user), a service booking system, and a real-time chat system.\n\nImportant Note on the Chat System: We do not want to use outdated methods like Ajax Polling (sending repetitive requests to the server). The chat system must be implemented using Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push messages from the server to the client in real-time, ensuring minimal load on server resources.\n\nThe front-end must be fully responsive, designed with a Mobile-First methodology using Bootstrap 5. We expect clean, secure, maintainable, and high-quality code.\n\nTechnology Stack\nFront-end: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), Bootstrap 5\nBack-end: Pure PHP version 8+ (Use of any framework is strictly prohibited)\nDatabase: MySQL with the PDO extension\nKey Technical Requirements (Non-negotiable)\nYour implementation must strictly adhere to the following standards:\n\nServer-Side Logic: All back-end logic, including routing, data processing, and session management, must be written in pure PHP (procedural or object-oriented).\nSecure Database Interaction: All database queries must be executed using the PDO (PHP Data Objects) extension. The use of Prepared Statements for all SQL operations is mandatory to prevent SQL Injection attacks.\nPassword Security: User passwords must be securely hashed using password_hash() and verified with password_verify(). The use of legacy algorithms like MD5 or SHA1 is not acceptable under any circumstances.\nReal-time Chat with SSE: The chat system between a consultant and a user must be implemented using Server-Sent Events (SSE). This will allow new messages to be delivered instantly with the lowest possible server overhead. Sending messages from the client can be handled via a standard POST request using the Fetch API.\nResponsive Design: The user interface must be fully responsive, built with a Mobile-First methodology and the Bootstrap 5 framework. All components must display correctly and be usable across all screen sizes, from small mobile devices to large desktops.\nClean & Modular Code: The PHP code must be well-structured, modular, and reusable. Common parts like the database connection, header, footer, and utility functions should be placed in separate, includable files.\nCore Features and Functionality\n1. Authentication System:\n\nUser registration form (including name, email/mobile, password) with full client-side and server-side validation.\nAutomatic generation of a unique username based on the email or mobile number.\nSecure login system using email/mobile and password.\nAutomatic redirection to the user’s role-specific dashboard upon successful login.\nA secure logout feature that completely destroys the user’s session.\nStrict access control for all protected pages based on user role and session status.\n2. Role-Based Dashboards:\n\nMain Admin: Full access to all system sections; can manage users (create, edit, delete, change roles), manage services, and view all reservations.\nSub Admin: Can manage users (except other admins), services, and all reservations.\nConsultant: Can only view and manage reservations assigned to them. Can chat with users associated with those specific reservations.\nUser: Can view their reservation history, book new services, and chat with their assigned consultant.\n3. Services and Booking System:\n\nA page displaying a list of service packages and selectable add-on services.\nA user-friendly booking form including a date/time picker, package selection, and checkboxes for add-on services.\nAn admin panel to view, approve, cancel, and assign consultants to new reservations.\nA consultant panel to view their assigned reservations and update their status (e.g., to “Completed”).\n4. Chat System (with an emphasis on SSE):\n\nOnce a reservation is approved and a consultant is assigned, a private chat channel is activated between the user and the consultant.\nThe client-side JavaScript code will use the EventSource API to establish a persistent connection with a PHP script to receive new messages in real-time.\nA server-side PHP script will manage the SSE connection and push new messages to the relevant client as soon as they are saved to the database.\nInitial Setup Script (setup.php)\nYou must provide a file named setup.php that performs the following tasks:\n\nConnects to the MySQL database.\nCreates all required tables using CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS (the schema and table structure will be provided).\nCreates a default Main Admin user and populates the database with a few sample services.\nDisplays a success message and recommends deleting the file after setup is complete for security reasons.\nHow to Apply (Your Proposal Requirements)\nTo be considered for this project, your proposal must include clear and direct answers to the following points. Proposals that fail to address these items will not be reviewed.\n\nExperience and Expertise: Briefly describe your relevant experience, especially with pure PHP development (non-framework) and implementing security features like PDO and Prepared Statements.\nLive Portfolio: Provide links to a few of your live, online projects that you have developed. Projects built with pure PHP are highly preferred.\nFinal Time and Cost: Please state the exact time required to complete the entire project (in days or weeks) and your final, fixed price for delivering all the specified features. Please avoid hourly rates or open-ended estimates.\nFree Support Period: Specify the duration (e.g., 30 days, 60 days, etc.) for which you will provide free support after the final delivery to fix any potential bugs or issues that may arise.\nWe are looking for a professional and transparent collaboration. We appreciate you taking the time to read our requirements carefully and look forward to receiving your comprehensive proposal.",

I want a smoother path that introduces a lightweight “Guest Login” step without forcing full account creation.\n\nHere’s the experience I’m after: when someone clicks “Buy Now” or drops an item into the cart, a small overlay should appear offering two buttons—create an account or continue as a guest.

Pages will be few but purposeful: a concise home/landing section, booking interface, brief “about” or information area, and contact.\n\nI’m flexible on the stack as long as it’s responsive, SEO-friendly, and easy for me to update later—WordPress with Elementor, Webflow, or a lightweight custom build are all fine if they achieve the look and performance. What matters is code quality, smooth user flow, and reliable integrations.\n\nPlease share examples of similarly minimalist sites you’ve designed, especially any with real-time booking. If this project runs smoothly, I have additional web and branding work lined up, so I’m keen to build an ongoing relationship with the right designer.",

Spinning up docker-compose (or a virtualenv) starts the API and the relational DB with no errors.\n2. Hitting /api/products/ returns paginated results in JSON.\n3. POSTing a valid product object creates it and returns HTTP 201.\n4. All endpoints require authentication; unauthenticated requests return 401.\n5. pytest or Django’s test runner reports green on at least one model and one viewset test.\n\nIf you love clean code, can communicate progress clearly, and can deliver the above quickly, I’d be happy to work with you.",

The data model will include a Product model with fields for name, description, price, SKU, inventory count, and timestamps, along with validation for data integrity.\n2.  **API Development:** We'll implement DRF with ModelViewSet to provide full CRUD operations. The endpoints will support list (with pagination and filtering by category or search term), create, update, and delete operations, all following RESTful standards.\n3.  **Security & Testing:** Authentication will be implemented using TokenAuthentication to secure all endpoints. We will include unit tests for models and views using pytest to ensure reliability and maintainability.\n4.  **Documentation & Delivery:** In addition to the code, we will provide a README with setup instructions, sample fixtures, and API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger) to ensure ease of use. All code will be containerized via Docker for local development.\n\nBased on the requirements, we estimate this effort at **$12,500**, inclusive of all development, testing, and documentation. We are prepared to begin immediately and can deliver within two weeks.\n\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver a high-quality, production-ready system that meets all your criteria.\n\nBest regards,\nAlphaFusion Corporation<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>",

This offers superior isolation, security, and scalability over shared hosting, without the cost of a full dedicated server.\n• Our team will handle the complete setup: OS hardening (SSH, firewall, fail2ban), web/application server (Nginx or Apache), domain binding, SSL/TLS certificate issuance (Let's Encrypt), and deployment of your application.\n• We will integrate monitoring (log rotation, health checks) and document every step in a reusable, clear deployment guide—including scripts, configs, and recovery steps.\n• Finally, we perform load testing and security validation before handing over the environment.\n\nThis phased approach ensures not only a successful launch, but also maintainable, secure, and scalable hosting that you can easily manage or expand in the future.\n\nGiven the scope, we can complete this in 48–72 hours. Our budget of $30,000 aligns with market rates for this specialized service and reflects our deep expertise in secure, large-scale application hosting.\n\nWe are ready to begin immediately.\n\nBest regards,\nAlphaFusion Corporation",

        "full_description": "1. Project Overview & Goal\n\nI am a PhD researcher. I need a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a data collection system to study team dynamics. The focus is on creating a reliable core system for collecting essential data.\n\nThe system will have two parts:\n\nA native Android application for 30 tablets to collect active (user-input) and simplified passive (sensor) data.\n\nA web-based Admin Panel to create questions, manage sessions, and download the final dataset.\n\nPlease note: Features like a live monitoring dashboard are out of scope for this MVP version. The primary goal is robust data collection and export.\n\n2. Core Component: The Android Participant App\nThe app will be installed on 30 Android tablets and must run in a locked \"Kiosk Mode\".\n\n2.1. Active Data Collection (Dynamic User Input)\n\nThe app will display up to three questions defined in the Admin Panel. It must support the following input types:\n\nYes/No: Displayed as two buttons.\n\nOpen Text: A simple text input field.\n\nScale (Slider): A horizontal slider with a configurable range (from 1-2 up to 1-7) set from the Admin Panel.\n\nEvery time a participant provides or changes an answer, the app must save the data point locally.\n\n2.2. Passive Data Collection (Simplified)\n\nThe app must collect the following data in the background:\n\nAmbient Noise Data: Measure the ambient sound level variance every 60 seconds. Important: Audio content must NOT be recorded. The app only needs to calculate a single value representing the variance/standard deviation of sound amplitude.\n\nActivity Data: Determine if the device is stationary (0) or in motion (1) using the accelerometer every 60 seconds.\n\nNote: Proximity/distance measurement using Bluetooth is NOT part of this MVP.\n\n2.3. Technical Requirements for the App:\n\nKiosk Mode: Lock the tablet to this app only.\n\nUnique ID: A unique ID for each tablet (Tablet_01 to Tablet_30).\n\nOffline Capability: All data must be stored locally first. If Wi-Fi is lost, the app must hold the data and sync it when reconnected.\n\nData Handling and Transmission: To optimize battery life and network usage, the app must handle data as follows:\n\nCollection: Passive sensor data is collected every 60 seconds and saved locally. Active user inputs are saved locally the moment they are made.\n\nTransmission: All locally saved data (both active and passive) should be sent to the server in a single batch every 5 minutes.\n\n3. Core Component: Web Admin Panel\nA password-protected web interface for the researcher with essential functions only.\n\n3.1. Main Functions:\n\nQuestion Management: A user-friendly interface to:\n\nCreate, edit, and save up to 3 questions for a research session.\n\nFor each question, define:\n\nQuestion Text.\n\nQuestion Type (Yes/No, Open Text, Scale).\n\nScale Range (max value from 2 to 7) if the type is Scale.\n\nSession Management: Simple \"START SESSION\" and \"END SESSION\" buttons.\n\nData Export: The most important feature. A button to \"Download All Data\" which generates a single .CSV file containing all data from all sessions.\n\n4. Data Structure for Export\nThe exported .CSV file is the key deliverable. It must be in a clean, \"long\" format, ready for analysis.\n\nExample columns for the .CSV file: session_id, device_id, timestamp, data_type, question_text, question_type, value_numeric, value_text\n\nExample rows:\n\ns01, Tablet_01, 2025-11-15T10:05:15Z, active_input, How do you feel?, Scale, 5, NULL\n\ns01, Tablet_01, 2025-11-15T10:06:00Z, passive_sound, NULL, 12.8, db_variance\n\ns01, Tablet_01, 2025-11-15T10:06:00Z, passive_activity, NULL, 1, moving\n\n5. What I am looking for:\nA developer or a team with experience in:\n\nNative Android development (Java/Kotlin).\n\nWorking with Android sensors (specifically Microphone and Accelerometer).\n\nBackend development (e.g., Node.js, Python, PHP) and databases.\n\nClear communication in English.\n\nPlease provide an estimated cost and timeline for this MVP project.\n\nPlease mention any similar projects you have worked on in the past.\n\nThank you for your consideration. I look forward to your proposals.\n\nPlease Note: This project posting is for budget planning and proposal gathering for a scientific research grant. We are currently evaluating the potential costs. This is the reason why our proposed budget is as is. The project is scheduled to begin in approximately 3-6 months. A final developer will be selected at a later date. Thank you for your proposals.",

All data will be encrypted in transit and at rest. The Android app will be sandboxed and secured against common exploits.\n\n2. **Android Development:** Using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for a modern, maintainable codebase. We will implement strict background service policies to manage sensors efficiently, ensuring battery life is preserved. The kiosk mode will be enforced via Android Management API.\n\n3. **Backend & Admin Panel:** A Node.js/Express or Python FastAPI backend with a React-based admin panel. The admin features (question management, session control, data export) will be built with granular permissioning and full audit logging.\n\n4. **Data Handling & Sync:** Robust offline storage using SQLite with encryption. A background sync service will handle network availability with exponential backoff. Data validation and deduplication will be implemented to ensure integrity.\n\n5. **Testing & Compliance:** Full unit and integration test coverage. All code will be version-controlled (Git) with continuous integration. Documentation and deployment playbooks will be provided.\n\n**Estimated Timeline:** 10–12 weeks\n**Estimated Budget:** $48,000 – $55,000 (depending on final feature lock and compliance requirements)\n\nWe are confident we can deliver this project on time and to specification.

        "full_description": "Project Title:\n\nBuild a Full Social Chat App with Stories, Reels, and Nearby User Detection (NearLink)\n\nProject Description:\n\nI want to develop a mobile social chat application called NearLink, which combines the best features of Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Telegram, and WhatsApp — but with a unique twist:\nUsers can detect and connect with other nearby users (who also have the app installed) as they physically pass by each other, without using Bluetooth.\n\nBelow is a detailed breakdown of what I need:\n\n1. Core Features\n\nReal-time chat (one-on-one and group chats)\n\nVoice and video calls\n\nMedia sharing (photos, videos, files)\n\nSelf-destructing messages\n\nEnd-to-end encryption for privacy\n\nPush notifications for messages and new connections\n\n2. Social Features\n\nStories (24-hour disappearing posts)\n\nReels / Short videos (15–60 seconds, with music, filters, and effects)\n\nProfile pages (bio, photo, username, followers/following)\n\nFeed / Explore section to see posts and reels from friends or nearby users\n\nLikes, comments, shares, tags, and hashtags\n\n3. Unique Feature – Nearby User Detection\n\nThis is the core innovation of the app.\n\nWhen two users with the app pass near each other, the app detects that they were in proximity (within about 30–100 meters).\n\nThe app then shows a notification: “You just passed by @username — connect?”\n\nThis feature should not use Bluetooth. It should rely on GPS and cloud-based location matching:\n\nThe app updates the user’s location periodically.\n\nThe backend compares locations to identify “proximity events.”\n\nUsers can choose to be visible or invisible (“Discovery Mode” toggle).\n\nAll location data must be temporary and privacy-safe.\n\n4. Additional Features\n\nAI suggestions like “People you passed by often”\n\nBasic video editing tools (for reels)\n\nOptional verification badges for popular users\n\nDark/light mode\n\nOptional business profiles for shops or creators\n\n5. Technology Stack (Suggested but open to recommendations)\n\nFrontend: Flutter or React Native\n\nBackend: Node.js with Firebase or Supabase\n\nDatabase: Firestore or PostgreSQL\n\nRealtime messaging: WebSockets or Firebase Realtime DB\n\nProximity detection: GPS + cloud-based encounter matching\n\nCloud hosting: Google Cloud, AWS, or similar\n\n6. Privacy & Permissions\n\nLocation data must never be stored permanently or displayed on a live map.\n\nUser must consent to proximity detection and can turn it off anytime.\n\nMust comply with Google Play and App Store privacy guidelines.\n\n7. Deliverables\n\nFully functional iOS and Android mobile apps\n\nAdmin panel for managing users and reports\n\nBackend server and API\n\nClean UI/UX design\n\nSource code with documentation\n\nBasic testing and bug fixing before final delivery\n\n8. Optional (If possible)\n\nInclude app logo and branding suggestions\n\nOption for future updates or long-term maintenance contract\n\nGoal\n\nCreate a unique, modern, and scalable social chat app that connects people not only online but also through real-world proximity — a fusion of chat, discovery, and social interaction.\n\nApp Name: NearLink\nPlatforms: iOS and Android\nCategory: Social Networking / Messaging",
